Revamp Plan

1. Theme and Design Elements

- Current State: Light theme with soft blue-gray/white backgrounds and a muted color palette (teal, gray, blue).
- New Vision: Transition to a dark theme with deep blues, purples, or blacks as the base, accented by subtle neon colors (e.g., teal, pink, cyan) for a futuristic look inspired by your appreciation for vibrant colors in sites like https://gianmarcocavallo.com/.
- Implementation:
  - Use a gradient background (e.g., #1a1a2e to #16213e) across sections.
  - Add neon glows (e.g., box-shadow: 0 0 10px #00ffcc) to key elements like the logo, navbar links, and buttons.
  - Incorporate custom fonts:
    - Headings: Futuristic fonts like Orbitron or Exo.
    - Body text: Clean, readable fonts like Poppins or Montserrat.

2. Navbar Enhancements

- Current State: Simple, centered navbar with uppercase text and no hover effects.
- Recommendations:
  - Add a neon underline or glow to active/hovered links (e.g., teal or cyan).
  - Use a custom font (e.g., Raleway Bold) for a unique touch.
  - Include a subtle 3D effect on the logo (e.g., slight rotation or shadow) using CSS transforms.

3. Home Section

- Current State: Circular profile image, greeting, and skill icons.
- Recommendations:
  - Create a full-screen hero area with a dark gradient and a subtle animation (e.g., particle effects via particles.js or a looping video), inspired by https://oakharborwebdesigns.com/.
  - Replace the profile image with a 3D rotating sphere showing your photo and logo, using Three.js or CSS.
  - Add a CTA button ("Explore My Work" or "Hire Me") with a neon border, glow, and 3D lift on hover.
  - Use a bold, futuristic font for your name and tagline.

4. About Section

- Current State: Service columns with text and icons.
- Recommendations:
  - Use a two-column layout: Bio/services on the left, skill icons on the right.
  - Add interactive hover effects to icons (e.g., scale up, neon glow) with tooltips showing project examples, inspired by https://walterspieler.dev/.
  - Apply parallax scrolling to the background for depth.

5. Work (Portfolio) Section

- Current State: Grid with project cards and filters.
- Recommendations:
  - Switch to a masonry grid for a dynamic layout, inspired by https://gianmarcocavallo.com/.
  - Add hover effects to cards (e.g., neon border, 3D tilt, overlay with details) using CSS or Framer Motion.
  - Style filter buttons with custom neon icons (e.g., React logo in cyan) and a glow on the active filter.
  - Implement lazy loading for images with a neon spinner or skeleton screen.

6. Skills Section

- Current State: Circular skill icons and experience timeline.
- Recommendations:
  - Replace icons with neon-outlined SVGs that animate on hover (e.g., pulse or color shift).
  - Use radial progress bars with neon fills (via react-circular-progressbar) to show proficiency levels.
  - Add a scroll-triggered animation to the timeline (e.g., fade-in entries with neon dots), inspired by https://www.sarahtrummer.com/.

7. Contact Section

- Current State: Form, contact details, and "Send Message" button.
- Recommendations:
  - Style form fields with neon borders and a glow on focus.
  - Enhance the "Send Message" button with a 3D press effect and neon glow on hover.
  - Add a loading animation (e.g., spinning neon circle) on form submission.
  - Include custom social media icons with hover animations (e.g., bounce or color change).

8. Interactivity and Effects

- Loading Effects: Add a preloader with a neon pulse or spinner (e.g., using React Spinners) and use lazy loading for components/images with React Suspense.
- 3D Effects: Apply CSS transforms or Three.js for 3D tilts on cards, icons, and buttons.
- Hover Effects: Use scale, rotate, or glow animations across interactive elements.
- Parallax Scrolling: Implement with React Scroll Parallax for a sense of depth.

9. Call-to-Action (CTA)

- Current State: Basic "Send Message" button in Contact.
- Recommendations:
  - Add a prominent CTA in the Home hero ("Hire Me" or "View My Work") with neon styling.
  - Include a sticky CTA button in the footer or as a floating element, ensuring itâ€™s always accessible.

10. Inspiration Integration

- Layouts: Use full-screen sections (https://oakharborwebdesigns.com/) and dynamic grids (https://gianmarcocavallo.com/).
- Colors: Dark base with neon accents (https://walterspieler.dev/).
- Interactivity: Hover and scroll animations (https://www.sarahtrummer.com/).
