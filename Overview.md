Based on the screenshots, your portfolio is clean and functional, with a light theme featuring a soft blue-gray or white background, a teal-branded logo ("#GeraComDev" or "@GeraComDev
"), and a consistent navbar across all sections. Here’s a quick summary of each section as observed:
Home: Features a circular profile image, a greeting ("Hello, I am Gerardo"), your title ("Full Stack Web Developer"), and icons for skills/interests (e.g., HTML5, React, coffee cup).

About: Includes a headline ("I Know That Good Design Means Good Business") and four service columns (Full Stack, Front End, Back End, Project Management) with social media icons.

Work: Displays a portfolio grid with project cards (e.g., React Blog App, WordPress site) and filtering options (e.g., Front-End, React, WordPress).

Skills: Showcases a grid of skill icons (e.g., JavaScript, Node.js, React) and a vertical experience timeline (e.g., Full Stack Web Developer at Amarillo College).

Contact: Offers a form with fields for name, email, and message, a "Send Message" button, contact details (email, phone), and social media icons.

The light theme is professional and approachable, but it lacks the futuristic flair and interactivity you envision. Let’s transform it into a modern, client-attracting portfolio with your desired features.
